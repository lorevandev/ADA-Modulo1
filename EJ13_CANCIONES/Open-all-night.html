    <h2> LETRA </h2>
    <p>
    I saw you coming from a mile away <br>
    Trying to hide behind that pretty face <br>
    Bet my last dollar baby you been bruised <br>
    Poor little heart all black 'n' blue <br> <br>

    Last thing you need's another pickup line <br>
    You must have heard them all a thousand times <br>
    God only knows what you been through <br>
    Believe me I been broken too <br> <br>

    It aches, it breaks, it takes your breath away <br>
    I've been around that block a time or two <br> <br>

    Baby, I don't want to fall in love with you <br>
    I try, try, try but I can't get around the truth <br>
    Please don't say my name, give this heart a break <br>
    I don't want to make the same mistake but it's too late <br>
    I'll leave on the light <br>
    These arms are open all night <br> <br>

    I got your taste in the back of my mouth <br>
    I want to reach in and pull it out <br>
    And I'd be lying if I didn't say <br>
    When you're this close I'm afraid <br>
    Of the way I'll feel if I touch your hair <br>
    The way I'll miss you when you're not there <br>
    And that I'll see you when I close my eyes <br>
    It's too late, I've crossed that line <br> <br>

    It breaks, it aches, it takes your breath away <br>
    I'll still be around come closing time <br> <br>
    
    Baby, I don't want to fall in love with you <br>
    I try, try, try but I can't get around the truth <br>
    Please don't say my name, give this heart a break <br>
    I don't want to make the same mistake but it's too late <br>
    I'll leave on the light <br>
    These arms are open all night <br> <br>

    It's 2 am, it's last call, baby. <br>
    The barkeep's gone, I'll walk you home now <br>
    Save me, baby <br> <br> 

    Baby, I don't want to fall in love with you <br>
    I try, try, try but I can't get around the truth <br> 
    Please don't say my name, give this heart a break <br>
    I don't want to make the same mistake but it's too late <br>
    I'll leave on the light <br>
    These arms are open all nigh
